Work ing Grou p #5 “Risk Assessmen t” developed \\na guide that th e DOE Complex can utilize to in corporate the concept of  risk assessmen t \\ninto their electrical safety programs. \\nWhat are  the benefits o f the best p ractice: The guide will be used by the DOE \\nComplex t o aid in in corporating risk assessmen t into their individual electrical saf ety \\nprograms. The guide also provides risk factor s and tools that can be used by electrical \\nworkers when performing re al-time risk assessments. \\nWhat problems/issues were associat ed with the best practic e: 2015 NFPA 70E \\naugmented the practice of performing a hazard analysis with a risk assessment process. \\nHow the success of the Best Pr actice was measur ed: Success will be measured by \\nthe use of this Best Practice into DOE complex electrical safety programs. \\nDescription of process experi ence usin g the Best Practice: N/ A EFCOG Best Practice #192\\nGuide to Incorporating the Risk Assessment Process into Integrated Safety \\nManagement for El ectrical Safety \\n1.0 \\nUnderstanding Risk Assessment \\nRisk Management is not a new concept, although it was first introduced into the \\n2015 edition of NFPA 70E, Standard for El ectrical Safety in the Workplace. The \\nterm risk assessment globally replaced hazard analysis throughout the standard. By definition, the term risk includes an aspect of likelihood of occurrence and therefore requires an assessment to evalua te the work that will be performed and \\nestimate the likelihood of how that work coul d lead to injury or damage to health.  \\nMany papers, standards, and guides have  been written to help understand and \\nexplain Risk Management. This best practice will focus on how to incorporate the terminology and concepts of Risk Ma nagement into how the DOE Complex \\ncurrently manages electrical safety thro ugh the Integrated Safety Management \\nprocess. References for some of these papers, standards, and guides will be \\nprovided at the end of this document.  \\nFig. 1-1. References to Understanding Risk Management \\nEFCOG Best Practice #192\\n2.0 Incorporating Risk Assessment  into Integrated Safety Management (ISM)  \\nRisk Assessment is an overall process to identify hazards, analyze risk (i.e. \\nestimate the likelihood of occurrence of harm and the potential severity of harm), \\nand evaluate risk (i.e. de termine if protective measures are required).  \\nThis section describes the process to perform a risk assessment for electrical hazards.  It describes how risk assessmen t can be integrated into the ISM model. \\nThe Subtitles in Section 2 are taken from the risk assessment model with the associated step from the ISM model shown in parenthesis following the subtitle. \\nPrior to beginning work that could involv e electrical hazards, a task-based risk \\nassessment must be performed to identify hazards, analyze and evaluate the risk, \\nand identify and document risk control measures.  \\nFig. 2-1. Integrating ISM and Risk Management \\n2.0.1 Task-based Risk Assessment (Define Work) \\nThe initial ISM step “Define Work” is similar to performing a task-based risk \\nassessment.  “Define work” involves clea ring identifying scop e of work and the \\ntasks necessary to accomplish that scope of work.  Similarly, the initial step of a task-based risk assessment involves breaking a job into discrete tasks. \\nEFCOG Best Practice #192\\n2.0.2 Risk Assessment (Analyze Hazards)  \\nAfter a job is broken into discrete task s then the risk assessment proceeds as \\ndescribed in Section 2.0: \\n1.Hazard Identification: Identify the hazards associated with each task .\\nIf two or m\\nore sequential tasks have the same electrical hazards and a similar level \\nof risk and require the use of similar risk control method s, then it may be possible \\nto merge those tasks and document them  as one larger task. However, if \\nsequential tasks have different electrical hazards or a different level of risk or \\nrequire the use of different risk cont rol methods, then the tasks must be \\ndocumented as separate, smaller tasks. \\nFor example, tasks such as working in an Electrically Safe Work Condition (Mode \\n0), Establishing an Electrically Safe Work Condition (Mode 1), and Performing Energized Diagnostics and Testing (Mode 2) each have different levels of risk and \\ntherefore must be documented as separate tasks. \\n2.Risk Analysis: The risk associated with each hazard is analyzed to establish a level of\\nrisk.\\nThe fol\\nlowing factors should be considered when analyzing risk: \\nA. Anal\\nyze the potential severity of the harm by identifying the hazard cl ass(es)\\n(source(s) \\nof energy) th at the worker could be exposed to. The  hazard\\nclassificat\\nion system takes into account the potential severity based on  thresholds\\nfor injury.\\nB. Es\\ntimate the likelihood of  occurrence of harm by identifying how the worker is\\ngoi\\nng to interact with the equipment and how that interaction might result in\\nexposure to hazardous energy. In so me DOE complexes the likelihood of\\noccurrence of harm can be defined by the Mode of Work classi fication system. As\\nthe \\nMode of Work cl assification number increases, the likelih ood of occurrence of\\nharm increases.C. A\\nnalyze factors that could affect the likelihood of occurren ce of harm  or the\\nseverity of \\nharm, or both (e.g. a shock ha zard in a wet enviro nment; an arc flash\\nhazard i\\nn a confined space; the condition of the equipment; the condition of th e\\nwork environment; the \\ncondit ion of the work or workers).  Some of these factors\\nare discu\\nssed in further detail in Section 3 of th is paper.\\n3.Risk\\n Evaluation: The level of risk is evaluated to determine if additional protective\\nmeasures are required.  One basis for determ ining whether or not ad ditional prot ective\\nmeasures are required is known as the ALARP prin\\nciple: Is the level of risk “As Low  As\\nReasonably Practicable”?  If n\\not, then risk controls are implemented from a hierarchy\\nof methods\\n to reduce the risk to such a level.EFCOG Best Practice #192\\n2.0.3 Identify and Document Risk Control Measures (Develop Controls) \\nEvaluate the risk and determ ine the necessary risk contro l measures that need to \\nbe incorporated. Document the risk and ri sk control measures in the appropriate \\nwork control documentation. This includes performing appropriate shock and arc \\nflash risk assessments. \\nRisk control measures should be based on the following hierarchy: \\n\\uf0b7eliminate the hazard,\\n\\uf0b7substitute with other materials,  processes, or equipment,\\n\\uf0b7incorporate engineered controls,\\n\\uf0b7increase the awareness of potential hazards by using signage, warnings,\\nand barricades\\n\\uf0b7utilize administrative controls,\\n\\uf0b7establish measures to ensure the appropriate selection, use, and\\nmaintenance of PPE.\\n2.0.4 Verify and Validate Risk Assessment & Control Measures (prior to Perform \\nWork) \\nPerform a pre-job brief to verify that a ll hazards have been accounted for by the \\nrisk assessment and validate that risk control measures adequately reduce the risk \\nto as low as reasonably po ssible. Evaluate en vironmental and worker conditions to \\nensure that additional risk control meas ures do not have to be incorporated.  \\n2.0.5 Real-Time Reevaluation of Risk Assessment and Control Measures \\n(Perform Work) During the evolution of the job, always watch for any changes in the equipment, \\nenvironment, and/or work/worker conditio ns to ensure that a change does not \\nwarrant incorporation of additional ri sk control measures. Pause work, as \\nappropriate, to ensure that work can continue safely. \\n2.0.6 Measure and Monitor (Feedback & Improvement) \\nUpon completion of the job, evaluate le ssons learned, near misses, and latent \\n(unidentified) hazards, with an emphas is of improvement for the next job.  EFCOG Best Practice #192\\n3.0 Factors that Affect Risk \\nMany factors could be considered when evaluating risk. Certain factors could \\nincrease the severity of the actual hazard , whereas other factors could increase or \\ndecrease the likelihood of occurrence. This section will breakdown factors that \\naffect risk into three categories; Condit ion of the Work and Worker, Condition of \\nthe Environment, and Condition of the Equipment. This section will provide the workers with some factors to consider when performing risk assessment, both \\nduring the initial planning stages, validating the controls, and when re-evaluating change in conditions during the job. \\n3.0.1 Condition of the Work and Worker \\nThe centerpiece of preventing accident s revolves around the worker and their \\nunderstanding of the work being performed.

243-3707          Melkie.Tega@science.doe.gov   \\n \\n \\nBrief Description of Best Practice:  This best practice  is developed to define and evaluate risk for \\nworking with medium and high voltage activities in the DOE complex.  \\n \\nWhy the best practice was used:  Electrical Utility tasks involve high hazard activities where the risk is \\noften undefined. This best practice is developed to assess the risk of high hazard activities to assist \\nDOE contractors in implementing  controls to reduce risk. These controls follow the hierarchy of \\ncontrol method defined in ISM and NFPA 70E. Additionally, human performance indicators and tools \\nare utilized to address the human element of risk.  \\n \\nWhat are the benefits of the best practice : Using this best practice will allow DOE contractors to \\nevaluate their high hazard tasks in order to reduce risk to an acceptable level. This best practice \\nprovides a common, systematic approach for all DOE contractors to evaluate their Electrical Utility  \\nOperations.   Making use of this systematic approach will enable each site to implement adequate \\nwork control to assure the proper rigor, staffing, and work method controls are in place and \\nimplemented for appropriate high -risk activities.  \\n \\nWhat problems/issues were associated with the best practice:  NFPA 70E requires electrical activities \\nto go through a risk assessment process; however, Electrical Utility Operations are exempted from \\nthose requirements. Electrical Utility Operations are among th e highest hazard activities performed on \\nDOE sites. This is developed to evaluate the risk of EUO high hazard task and provide methods for \\nimplementing risk control.  \\n \\nHow the success of the Best Practice was measured:  This best practice was developed using  several \\nexperienced EUO personnel from multiple DOE sites.  EFCOG Best Practice #240  \\nElectrical Utility Risk Assessment  \\n \\nDescription of process experience using the Best Practice:  The known operating experience to date is \\nlimited to a few sites associated with the development of this product who have successfully \\nemployed some or all of the components of this Best Practice at their respective sites.  \\nScope and Applicability  \\nThe best practice applies to Electrical Utility Operations (EUO) at United States Department of Energy \\n(DOE) sites. The risk assessment herein covers the scope of high hazard electrical work not covered by \\nNFPA 70E Electrical Safety in the Workplace . \\nNote: The information provided is intended to be modified by each facility to meet their applicable \\nmission, roles, staffing, and tasks.  \\nRoles and Responsibilities:  \\nLine Manager  • Review high risk work to determine if appropriate hierarchy \\nof controls are implemented.  \\n• Review and approve energized electrical work requiring a \\npermit.  \\nForeman/Supervisor  • Participate in the pre -job and/or package walkdown.  \\n• Provide oversight as needed for the assigned task.  \\nEngineer/Planner  • Participate in the pre -job and/or package walkdown.  \\n• Prepare the work package.  \\n• Involve appropriate Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) as \\nappropriate.  \\n• Utilize the Risk Assessment Matrix detailed in this best \\npractice.  \\n• Provide field technical expertise, as needed.  \\n• Provide interface with Engineering and Design personnel to \\nensure that risks and safety hazards encountered in the field \\nare considered.  \\nAdditional Worker  • Participate in the pre -job and/or package walkdown  \\n• Trained and prepared for emergency rescue.  \\n• Satisfies the 2 -person rule.  \\n• Implement Human Performance Indicators ( HPI) principles to \\nreduce the severity of consequences of human error.  \\nCrew Chief / Lead Worker  • Participate in the pre -job and/or package walkdown  \\n• Trained and prepared for emergency rescue.  \\n• Satisfies the 2 -person rule.  \\n• Implement HPI principles to reduce the severity of \\nconsequences of human error.  \\n• Serves as the Employee in Charge.  \\nSafety  • Participate in work package  planning and walkdowns.  \\n• Assists with recognition and control of hazards.  \\n• Provide technical guidance in the work planning process.  \\n  EFCOG Best Practice #240  \\nElectrical Utility Risk Assessment  \\n \\n \\nPerforming a Risk Assessment for High Hazard Electrical Utility Operation Tasks:  \\n \\nIden tify the Scope and Hazards   \\n1. Identify the  scope of work that will be assessed for risks.  \\n2. Perform a planning walk -down  and/or table -top to identify hazards  (shock, arc flash, environmental, \\nchemical exposure, work from heights, etc.) associated with the task(s). Involve appropriate SMEs , \\nas needed . \\n3. Identify possible situations that could develop into accidents during work task , considering \\nserious/ high impact , but credible, scenarios.  \\n \\nCatego rization   \\n1. Using Table 1, o rganize scenarios into one of the following three  categories, according to what \\nwould be impacted by an accident:  More than one may apply.  \\n• People  \\n• Equipment  – including critical system operational function  \\n• Environment  \\n \\nAssign Consequences  and Severity  \\n1. Review the Consequence and Severity Definition of Scale . \\n2. Select the most appropriate severity  using:  \\n• Site documented events  \\n• DOE documented events  \\n• Electrical Utility i ndustry documented events.  \\n3. Document the severity  for the selected scenario .  \\n \\nEstimate Likelihood  \\n1. Select the most appropriate likelihood using:  \\n• Site documented events  \\n• DOE documented events  \\n• Electrical Utility industry documented events.  \\n2. Document the likelihood for the selected scenario.  \\n EFCOG Best Practice #240  \\nElectrical Utility Risk Assessment  \\n \\n \\nUtilize the Risk Assessment Matrix  and Implementing Controls  \\n1. Calculate risk. Risk = Severity  × Likelihood . \\nExample:  Environmental Release  that has previously occurred at the facility  \\nSeverity  (4) × Likelihood  (3) = Total Risk (12) \\n2. Record the risk score current work practice  controls . \\n3. If evaluated risk is unacceptable, utilize the hierarchy of risk control method to im plement additional \\ncontrols to reduce risk. Examples of hierarchy of risk control methods are below:  \\n• Elimination  \\no Conductors and/or circuit parts de -energized, have a visible open, and are \\nequipotentially grounded  \\n• Substitution  \\no Remote device operation  \\no Reduce energy to below hazardous energy thresholds  \\n• Engineering  \\no Adjusting relay protection  \\no Arc flash reduction maintenance switch  \\n____Controls below this should have redundancy in implementation  – \\nConsider utilizing HPI tools/concepts ___ \\n• Awareness  \\no Signs, barricades, barriers  \\no Labels  \\no Attendant/Spotter  \\n• Administrative  \\no 3-part communication for switching  \\no Training  \\no Procedures  \\n• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)  \\no Shock and arc flash PPE  \\n \\n  EFCOG Best Practice #240  \\nElectrical Utility Risk Assessment  \\n \\nTable 1: Risk Assessment Matrix  \\nSeverity  Consequence  Probability – Increasing Likelihood  \\n1 2 3 4 5 \\nPeople  Equipment  Environment  Event \\nnever \\nheard of \\nin the \\nindustry  Event h eard \\nof in the \\nindustry  Event has \\noccurred in \\nsimilar \\ncompany  Event happens \\nseveral times \\nper year  Event occurs \\nseveral times \\nper year in a \\nspecific location  \\n1 No health \\neffects or injury  No damage  No effect  1 2 3 4 5 \\n2 Slight health \\neffect of injury  \\n(first aid)  Minor \\ndamage  Minor effect  2 4 6 8 10 \\n3 Minor health \\neffect of injur y \\n(outpatient)  Localized \\ndamage  Contained \\neffects  3 6 9 12 15 \\n4 Major injury \\nrequiring \\nsurgery, \\nhospitalization \\nor extensive \\ntreatments  Major \\ndamage  Uncontained \\neffects  4 8 12 16 20 \\n5 Fatalities  Extensive \\ndamage  Extensive \\nGeographic \\neffects  5 10 15 20 25 \\nLow 1 - 6 Medium  7 - 12 High 1 3 - 25 \\nNote: Each site should establish the site-specific  thresholds for consequence and severity.  \\n \\nHuman Performance  \\n1.
