      "Answer: Cyber security risks involve threats or vulnerabilities that could exploit weaknesses in an organization's systems, processes, or people, potentially causing harm such as financial loss, reputational damage, operational disruption, or legal complications. Based on the provided context, examples of cyber security risks include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Failure to Implement Proper Policies and Procedures:**\n",
      "   - Not maintaining or testing a comprehensive cyber security policy or incident response procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Breaches:**\n",
      "   - Unauthorized access, exposure, or theft of sensitive or personal information.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Account Compromise:**\n",
      "   - Unauthorised access to email or operational accounts, leading to data loss, corruption, or theft.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Hacking:**\n",
      "   - Malicious actors gaining unauthorized access to systems or networks to exploit data or disrupt normal operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Insider Threats:**\n",
      "   - Malicious insiders, such as employees or contractors, misusing their access to steal data, sabotage systems, or harm the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Phishing and Quishing:**\n",
      "   - Fraudulent attempts via email, messages, or QR codes to trick employees into revealing personal or organizational information, often leading to malware installations or data breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Ransomware and Malware:**\n",
      "   - Malicious software that encrypts data, demands ransom, or disrupts systems by unauthorized access or data theft.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Business Email Compromise:**\n",
      "   - Scams through email to steal goods, money, or sensitive information by impersonating trusted entities.\n",
