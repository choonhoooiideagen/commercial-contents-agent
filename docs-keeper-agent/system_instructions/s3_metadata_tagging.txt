    "summary": "In order to use the Idea-Gen-AI API, you require a client ID and a client secret. There are three endpoints available which are the AU, EU, and US endpoints. Each endpoint varies in region and has different model availabilities",

    "has_safe_operating_procedure": true,
    "has_report": false,

```json

    "has_checklist": false,
    "has_policy": true,
    "has_safe_operating_procedure": true,
